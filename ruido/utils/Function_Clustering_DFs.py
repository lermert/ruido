MODIFIED VERSION OF LOIC VIENS' clustering code.

The original code can be found at:
https://github.com/lviens/2020_Clustering

Modification:
Return principal component object rather than directly clustering,
with the goal to expand a larger dataset in the principal component
basis, and then return to do the clustering on this larger dataset.
